	<!-- I am using this page as the URL for a NFC card if I make one. (NFC is Near Field Communication, where you can just tap the card to a phone and it will open the link). The reason that I will have it open this page is because this page just redirects, so if I want to change what the card opens, I can just change where this page redirects to. -->
